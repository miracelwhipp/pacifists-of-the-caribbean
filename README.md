# Pacificsts of the Caribbean

A cooperative board game, where you try to omit as many human loss as you can in a 17th century naval battle.

## set up

Each player is on a different ship which is placed in front of him. The ship has markers for **sails**, **crew** and **hull** - 12 each. 
<!-- 12 is an arbitrary number here, I think its value will depend on the number of rounds played -->
